# ObjectDetectionPipeline
A C++ project that builds a complete video processing pipeline using FFmpeg and OpenCV to detect objects in video frames. The project decodes a video stream, processes frames to detect and annotate objects with bounding boxes, and re-encodes the video with detections applied.
